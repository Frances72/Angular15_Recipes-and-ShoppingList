# CourseProjectStartingProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.0.

This application is the result of an Angular course presented on UDEMY by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller, course name 'Angular - The Complete Guide (2024 Edition)
'.
The course content was created in Angular versions up to version 15, therefore this application does not reflect the changes to version 16, 17, 18.

The user experience is to create their own login credentials, then log into the application, fetch the existing food recipes and then manage the recipes one-by-one.
The user has the option of adding the recipe ingredients to the shopping list, editing the recipe or deleting the recipe.
The user can also add a new recipe and save it to the data base.
The database used is Google's mobile and web app development platform for single users, free version.
Only users with valid login credentials can access the website.
The authorization token granted to the user is valid for 60 minutes. Thereafter the user is automatically logged out of the application. Alternatively, a user can log themselves out using the Logout functionality.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
